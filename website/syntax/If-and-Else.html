            <h2> If and Else Statements </h2>

            <p>
                If statements are used to run a certain scope of code if a condition is true.
                Else statements are used to run a certain scope of code if the condition is false.
                Elif statements are used to run a certain scope of code if the previous condition is false and the current condition is true.
            </p>

            <p>
                The keywords use the corresponding 'if', 'else', and 'elif' keywords.
                Their conditions are not required to be in parentheses but must be followed by a colon.
                The scope of the code is defined by curly brackets unless the scope is only one line.
            </p>

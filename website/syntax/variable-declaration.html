            <h2> Variable declaration </h2>

            <p>
                Variables in lx types are hard coded.
                This means that the type of the variable cannot be changed at runtime.
                This is because C++ is a statically typed language.
                <br>
                Also similiar to C++ you can define a variable without a value.
                This is useful for when you want to define a variable but you don't have a value for it yet.
                Note that the variable will be undefined until you assign a value to it.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> int var1 = 0; <br> int var2; # Undefined </p>
            </div>

            <h2> Types </h2>

            <h3> Int and Float </h3>

            <p>
                Int and Float are both reprsentations of numbers.
                Int is a whole number and float is a decimal number.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> int var1 = 0; <br> float var2 = 0.0; </p>
                <p> # var3 will have a contents of 3 due to truncation <br> int var3 = 3.1459 </p>
                <p> # var4 will have a contents of 3.1459 because it is a float <br> float var4 = 3.1459 </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Ints are defined by the 'int' keyword and floats are defined by the 'float' keyword.
                You can also make it unsigned by adding the 'unsigned' keyword before the type.
                This means that the number cannot be negative.
            </p>

            <h3> Bool </h3>

            <p>
                Bool is a representation of a true or false value.
                It is defined by the 'bool' keyword.
            </p>

            <p>
                The values are 'true' and 'false'.
                The first letter can be capitalized or lowercase.
                You can also use '1' and '0' to represent true and false.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> # All variables store true <br> bool var1 = True; <br> bool var2 = true; <br> bool var3 = 1; </p>
            </div>

            <h3> Char and String </h3>

            <p>
                Char is a single ASCII character.
                If you do not know what ASCII is find out 
                
                <a href = "https://www.ascii-code.com" target = "_blank">
                    here.
                </a>

                <br>
            
                It is defined by the 'char' keyword.
            </p>

            <p>
                String is a collection of characters.
                It is defined by the 'string' keyword.
                You can access the individual characters of a string by using the [] operator.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p> # Stores the letter 'a' <br> char var1 = 'a'; </p>
                <p> string var2 = "Hello"; <br> char var3 = var2[0]; </p>
            </div>

            <h3> Void </h3>

            <p>
                Void is a type that represents nothing.
                It is defined by the 'void' keyword.
                It is used for functions that do not return a value.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also use void as a type for a variable.
                This means that the variable does not have a type.
                This is useful for when you want to store a pointer to any type (however it is recommended to use a base class pointer).

            <h2> Binary Logical Operators </h2>

            <p>
                Binary logical operators are used to compare two values.
                They return a boolean value.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two sets of binary logical operators.
                The first set is the comparison operators (!=, ==, <, >, <=, >=).
                The second set is the logical operators (and, or, not) which can also be written as (&&, ||, !).
            </p>

            <p>
                Comparison operators are used to compare two values of the same type.
                == and != are the only operators that can be used on all types.
                The rest can only be used on arethmetic types.
            </p>

            <p>
                Logical operators are used to compare two boolean values.
                'and' returns true if both values are true.
                'or' returns true if at least one value is true.
                'not' returns true if the value is false.
            </p>

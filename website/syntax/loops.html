            <h2> While Loops </h2>

            <p>
                While loops are used to run a certain scope of code while a condition is true.
                It follows the same syntax as the if statement.
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    while True: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print("Who loves infinite loops?"); <br>
                    } <br>

            <h2> For Loops </h2>

            <p>
                For loops are used to run a certain scope of code a certain number of times.
                It follows the same syntax as the while loop for the contents of the loop.
            </p>

            <p>
                By default the for loop starts at 0 and goes up to the number before the number you specify (iterating by 1 each time).
            </p>

            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    for int i count [5]: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print(i, ", "); <br>
                    } <br>

                    <br>
                    # This will print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, <br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                You can also specify the starting number and the increment.
            </p>
            
            <div class = "code">
                <p>
                    # Starts on 1 <br>
                    # Goes up to 5 <br>
                    # Iterates by 2 <br>
                    <br>
                    for int i count [1, 5, 2]: <br>
                    { <br>
                        &emsp; console::print(i, ", "); <br>

            <h3> Range based for loops </h3>

            <p>
                Instead of iterating through a range the size of the container you can iterate through the container itself.
                For each iteration you will be given a reference to the current element.
                This means any changes you make to the element will be reflected in the container.
            </p>
